plant <- read.csv(here('Project/PLNT21.csv'), stringsAsFactors = TRUE, skip = 1)
gen <- read.csv(here('Project/GEN21.csv'), stringsAsFactors = TRUE, skip = 1)
poverty <- read.csv(here('Project/PovertyEstimates.csv'), stringsAsFactors = TRUE, skip = 3)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
